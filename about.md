# What is this all about?

The Free Media Alliance has three main goals:

* Enable a collaborative network for people creating socially conscious work
* Provide a knowledge sharing hub related to 21st century media self-defense tactics and content production
* Promote events designed to foster a deeper sense of community connection through creative media production

## Guiding Vision

The Free Media Alliance aims to advance the notion that **a well informed *and* inspired citizen is the most important component in a healthy democratic society.** The relationship between media producer and media consumer has not only been flipped on its head in the past decade, it has become something completely new and different. Consumers are producers, producers are consumers, everyone is a critic, and no one is an expert. The very notion that there is an objective, shared reality described by factual evidence has been called into question. It is within this context that the Free Media Alliance seeks to operate as a community resource.

We strive to bring independent producers together to collaborate and teach within the broader community, hosting workshops, themed hack-a-thons, talks and forums to present and promote socially conscious work and a culture of active production.

In addition to fostering collaborative production, we also seek to serve as a media literacy resource center, sharing information and promoting events covering a wide range of issues surrounding the consumption of physical and electronic media. This covers things like privacy rights, implicit identity bias, net-neutrality, editorial practices and philosophies, media economics, and more.

We want to create a space for people from a diverse set of backgrounds and skills to get together and **do work that moves people forward...** using any channel, style, or genre available. If you write, edit, promote, produce, design, develop, direct, manage, fundraise, market, sell, or conceptually manifest words, videos, apps, websites, posters, screenplays, scripts, photos, sounds, tweets, posts, and whatnot...

## Modus Operandi

We are not alone in seeking to advance the public good through media. As such, we will conduct ourselves in alignment with the [**Electronic Frontier Alliance Principles:** ](https://www.eff.org/electronic-frontier-alliance)

> As a member organization of the EFA, we believe that technology should support the intellectual freedom at the heart of a democratic society. In the digital age, that entails advancing:

> **Free Expression:**
People should be able to speak their minds to whoever will listen.

> **Security:**
Technology should be trustworthy and answer to its users.

> **Privacy:**
Technology should allow private and anonymous speech, and allow users to set their own parameters about what to share with whom.

> **Creativity:**
Technology should promote progress by allowing people to build on the ideas, creations, and inventions of others.

> **Access to Knowledge:**
Curiosity should be rewarded, not stifled.

> We uphold these principles by fighting for **transparency and freedom in culture, code, and law.**
